{"body":"# pyAvroPhonetic\r\n\r\nA Python implementation of the popular Bengali phonetic-typing software\r\n[Avro Phonetic](http://omicronlab.com/).\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n========\r\n\r\n**pyAvroPhonetic** provides a Python package that can be imported and used\r\nby other Python programs or scripts. It implements the _Avro Phonetic\r\nDictionary Search Library_ by [Mehdi Hasan Khan](http://github.com/mugli).\r\n\r\n*N.B. This package is still experimental and is not (yet) fit for\r\nproduction use.*\r\n\r\n## Inspirations\r\n\r\nThis package is inspired from [Rifat Nabi](https://github.com/torifat)'s [jsAvroPhonetic](https://github.com/torifat/jsAvroPhonetic). So\r\nfar, the code is a direct (and shameless) translation of\r\njsAvroPhonetic into Python.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nUsing Git:\r\n\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/kaustavdm/pyAvroPhonetic\r\n    $ cd pyAvroPhonetic\r\n    $ sudo python setup.py install\r\n\r\nUsing Pip:\r\n\r\n    $ sudo pip install PyAvroPhonetic\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nAt present only a subset of features have been implemented. When\r\nimplemented, the parser can be accessed as:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyavrophonetic import avro\r\n>>> print avro.parse('aami banglay gaan gai')\r\nআমি বাংলায় গান গাই\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n**Fork** -> **Do your changes** -> **Send a Pull Request**. It's that\r\neasy!\r\n\r\nCoding style follows [PEP 8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) along with [PEP 257](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) for Docstring\r\nconventions.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you find any bugs, please report them in the Issues queue. As\r\nalways, before you report any new issue, please check that it has not\r\nbeen already posted by someone else.\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\n\r\n - Mehdi Hasan Khan for originally developing and maintaining Avro\r\n   Phonetic\r\n - Rifat Nabi for porting it to Javascript\r\n - [Md Enzam Hossain](https://github.com/ienzam) for helping me understand the ins and outs of\r\n   the Avro dictionary and the way it works\r\n - [Sarim Khan](https://github.com/sarim) for writing ibus-avro which helped to clarify my\r\n   concepts further\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2013 Kaustav Das Modak <kaustav.dasmodak@yahoo.co.in>.\r\n\r\n    This file is part of pyAvroPhonetic.\r\n\r\n    pyAvroPhonetic is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    pyAvroPhonetic is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
